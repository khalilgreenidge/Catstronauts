# Catstronauts
The beginning of my journey to building a full-stack GraphQL application called Catstronauts, a learning platform for adventurous cats who want to explore the universe! ðŸ˜º ðŸš€ Proudly thanks to this [course](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/lift-off-part1).


## How to use this repo

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `yarn install`.
1. Run `yarn start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `yarn install`.
1. Run `yarn start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
